# DATAMIND 
DATAMIND is the **UK’s Health Data Research Hub for Mental Health**. Our goal is to unlock the full potential of the UK’s rich mental health data to support coordinated research and improve mental health care.

We aim to change how the NHS, researchers, charities, and industry share and use information that already exists—safely and responsibly. Covering all four UK nations, we offer a central infrastructure with :clipboard: data, :wrench: tools, and :bookmark_tabs: guidance to transform how mental health research is done.

# DATAMIND-UK

DATAMIND-UK is DATAMIND’s official GitHub Organization account. The term *organization* comes from GitHub’s lexicon and refers to the type of GitHub account, and not to DATAMIND’s structural organization as a Hub (team, partners, etc). Therefore, it is important to differentiate between DATAMIND-UK ([GitHub Organization account](https://github.com/DATAMIND-UK)) and DATAMIND ([the Hub itself](https://datamind.org.uk/about-us/)).

## DATAMIND-UK's mission

DATAMIND-UK aims to bring together a community of researchers and developers working (or simply interested) on mental health data science, while fostering discussion, collaboration and open science. This space is open to anyone—whether you’re embedded in DATAMIND, part of a partner institution, or simply interested in mental health data science.

## Why join DATAMIND-UK?

You can find general information about GitHub Organizations [here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations). However, some of the main benefits we would like to highlight are:

:white_check_mark:**Community:** Connect with others passionate about mental health data science.

:white_check_mark:**Early access:** Get early insights into projects shared within the organisation.

:white_check_mark:**Structured collaboration:** Manage access and roles easily using GitHub Teams.

## Why contribute to DATAMIND-UK?

Some of the reasons to host your projects in DATAMIND-UK instead of (only on) your personal GitHub account are:

:white_check_mark: **Visibility**: Share your work with a focused community of mental health data scientists and stakeholders.

:white_check_mark: **Open science**: Make your work more accessible, reusable, and impactful.

:white_check_mark: **Collaboration:** Connect with others who can support or enhance your project.
