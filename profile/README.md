# DATAMIND-UK

DATAMIND-UK is DATAMIND’s official GitHub Organization account. The term *organization* comes from GitHub’s lexicon and refers to the type of GitHub account, and not to DATAMIND’s structural organization as a Hub (team, partners, etc). Therefore, it is important to differentiate between DATAMIND-UK ([GitHub Organization account](https://github.com/DATAMIND-UK)) and DATAMIND ([the Hub itself](https://datamind.org.uk/about-us/)).

## DATAMIND-UK's aim

DATAMIND-UK aims to bring together a community of researchers and developers working (or simply interested) on mental health data science, while fostering discussion, collaboration and open science. This applies to everyone, both inside and outside of DATAMIND.

- *Community:* Access to a community of researchers and developers with a shared pations for mental health data science.
- *Early access:* Early access to mental health data science projects when project owners decide to share their repositories with DATAMIND-UK members, regardless of general public access policy.
- *Team access control:* GitHub Organizations allows you to create teams and sub-teams, defining clear and organized structures, and simplifying the management of access for people.
